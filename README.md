# miniRT - My First Ray Tracer

A simple ray tracer built in C using the MiniLibX graphics library.
This project was developed in a group, by JoÃ£o Barbosa and Ivan Teixeira.

## Overview

This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of ray tracing, allowing the rendering of simple computer-generated images. Ray tracing is a rendering technique that produces a high degree of visual realism by tracing the path of light rays and simulating their interactions with virtual objects.

## Features

- Rendering of basic geometric shapes:
  - Spheres
  - Planes
  - Cylinders
- Light management:
  - Ambient lighting
  - Diffuse lighting
  - Hard shadows
- Camera with adjustable field of view
- Scene description using custom .rt configuration files
- Interactive scene navigation:
  - Move camera with WASD keys
  - Rotate camera with arrow keys
  - Select and modify objects
